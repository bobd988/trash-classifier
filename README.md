# Trash Classifier

## Introduction

To run a machine learning model on a GPU on trash can is not good idea as there can be cost and space restrictions. If everythign runs on Cloud is not good too as this always making an API call can have latencies and internet might not always be available.

In these cases using small, cheap devices is the best solution.

## Setup
This project requires python3.6 and opencv.
